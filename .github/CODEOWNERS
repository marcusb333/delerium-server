# CODEOWNERS file
# This file defines code owners for different parts of the repository.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Owners are GitHub usernames or team names (prefixed with @)
#
# Order is important - the last matching pattern takes precedence.
# More specific patterns should be listed after more general ones.

# Global owners - all files in the repository
